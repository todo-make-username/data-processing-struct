# Data Processing Struct
If you have an array with unprocessed and unvalidated raw data, but want a typed object instead, this is for you!

## Overview
One main pain point for anyone working in PHP is processing and validating associative arrays that come from various sources ($_POST, PDO, json_decode, etc). Then we run into the repetitive task of having to revalidate that the data we want exists in the array and it is the correct type, every time we use that data in a new method (I mean, you don't have to, but it is safer that way). This can be nearly eliminated by passing around pre-processed data objects (like a struct in other languages) instead of arrays. This library is how we turn those arrays into objects while also processing and validating the data without all the boilerplate.

**There are 4 main actions this library was designed to help with:**
1. Hydrate an object's public properties using an associative array of data.
	* Hydration attributes can act as chainable setter methods that can use the incoming data to assign the object's property something different.
	* For example, when the attribute `#[JsonDecode(true)]` is used on a property, it will expect a json string during hydration and then parses it. Then it uses that array in the next hydration attribute or saves it to the property.
		* That can then be chained with a custom attribute to take the array data and hydrate a different data object to be saved to the property. With just those 2 attributes you removed a lot of processing from your main flow.
1. While hydrating an object, the values from the array will be automatically converted to the property's type if it can.
	* This can be turned off if desired.
1. Clean up an object's values using altering attributes.
	* Things like automatically running `trim`, or `str_replace` on a handful of properties only requires you to add the corresponding attribute to the desired properties on the object.
	* These attributes are called `tailor attributes` in this library. Because a tailor 'alters' clothing. (I really just couldn't think of a better name in the moment)
1. Validate an object's properties using validation attributes.
	* For example, you can set up an attribute that checks if the value of a property matches a regex pattern, or that the value must pass an `!empty` check.

#### Common Use Cases:
* Typing and validating form data.
* Simple DB Mappers.
* API responses.
* Basically anything that has an array that would be better off as a typed object.

Did I mention that this library is fully extendable? You don't need to use any of my pre-made attributes. You can easily add your own hydration/tailor/validation attributes. As long as they extend my base attribute classes, the helpers will automatically pick up on them.

## Requirements
* PHP >= 8.2

Yup, that's it. Since this doesn't do anything fancy and mostly relies on built-in PHP features, no need for any external libraries for now.

The dev requirements are just the typical phpunit and php stan, and code sniffer.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Installation
**Quick Note:** It is not currently set up as a composer package in packagist, I like pulling from github directly in my stuff. If a feature request is made in Github Issues, not by me, to add it as a composer package, I'll look into setting that up.

To install via composer, you need to have it look at this repo directly by modifying your `composer.json`. You'll need to add the repo information in the `repositories` section with your desired version number, or add the section if it doesn't exit. Then add the "package" to your `require` section. Then lastly run `composer update`.


composer.json
```
"require": {
    ...,
    "todomakeusername/data-processing-struct": "*"
},

...

"repositories": [
    {...},
	{
		"url": "https://github.com/todo-make-username/data-processing-struct.git",
		"type": "git",
	},
    {...},
]
```

## Quick Example of Usage:
In this example we will look at $_POST data. When it comes to arrays, the data doesn't follow strict guidelines which causes bugs. This library simplifies the validation and data processing for you. Below, you'll see I create an object which has properties that corresponds with the expected $_POST keys. By moving away from arrays and towards data driven objects, we can create cleaner code which produces fewer bugs.

Here is a quick and dirty example of how it can be used on $_POST data after a form submission to prepare the data.
```PHP
/**
 * We will be pretending this is coming from a form for a product review.
 *
 * This class has properties that match what we are expecting $_POST to contain.
 * The exception being the file upload one, which looks at $_FILES instead.
 */
class ReviewFormData extends Struct
{
	#[Trim]     // Tailor Attribute
	#[NotEmpty] // Validation Attribute
	public string $name;

	// For this example, this is a checkbox, and therefore must have a default value if it is unchecked.
	public bool $is_public_review = false;

	public int $star_rating;

	#[StrReplace('*cat sitting on spacebar*', '')] // Tailor Attribute
	#[Trim]                                        // Tailor Attribute
	#[UseDefaultOnEmpty]                           // Tailor Attribute
	public ?string $review_text = null;

	// FileUpload is a hydration attribute that pulls the data automatically from the $_FILES array.
	//		the optional param will format the array into a cleaner format for multi-uploads.
	#[FileUpload(transpose: true)] // Hydration Attribute
	public array $review_image_uploads;
}

...

// This is the data we got from the form:
// is_public_review was a checkbox. For this example it was unchecked, which doesn't come though.
$_POST = [
	'name' => 'Nonya',
	'review_text' => 'I liked this product.       *cat sitting on spacebar*             ',
	'star_rating' => '4',
];

$_FILES = [
	'review_image_uploads' => [
		// This example will say there are 2 files.
	]
];

...

// Now somewhere else in the codebase where the form data is processed.
$FormObject = new ReviewFormData();

// The object's properties were set using the from $_POST and $_FILES. 
// The values were also converted to the proper types. 
$FormObject->hydrate($_POST);

// StrReplace ran on the review_text property.
// Trim trimmed the designated properties.
// UseDefaultOnEmpty didn't do anything since that field had a value.
$FormObject->tailor();

// Validation is run. Any failure messages can be retrieved with getMessages.
$Response         = $FormObject->validate();
$is_valid         = $Response->success;
$response_message = ($is_valid)
		? 'Success'
		: implode(PHP_EOL, $ObjectValidator->getAllMessages());

...

// The resulting object property values:
$FormObject->name                 => 'Nonya'
$FormObject->is_public_review     => false
$FormObject->star_rating          => 4
$FormObject->review_text          => 'I liked this product.'
$FormObject->review_image_uploads => [ [ `File 1 Data` ], [ `File 2 Data` ] ]
```

## Documentation
This library is fairly simple, it contains a base Struct class which three traits that incorporates hydration, tailoring, and validation. It also contains some pre-made attributes for you to use that take care of some of the more common things. I've also built a demo for you to use and play with. How to run the demo is at the bottom of this readme.

#### Useful Info:
* Attributes are run in order from top to bottom.
* Only the attributes associated with the method that was called are run.
* Each helper only looks at an object's public properties.
	* Yes, I can technically also do the private/protected properties using reflection. It wont happen because that breaks the whole purpose behind private/protected. That said, if there is a use case that would be deemed essential to have that feature, I can look into opening that up. It better be a good reason though.
* For attribute arguments, use named parameters. It makes things easier for everyone. You can do it the old way if you want, but I recommend using named parameters where you can for self documenting code.
* When using this library to handle form submissions, it is highly recommended to have default values for any property that has form data that may not be sent over. Like checkboxes. Otherwise PHP might start yelling at you about accessing uninitialized properties.
* Hydrating properties which can be converted from a string can be hydrated with an object as long as the `__toString()` magic method is set up.
* Fun Fact: I use the demo as a testing ground for changes.
* Sad Fact: This library cannot work with readonly properties as those can only be set from within the object itself and cannot be changed once set.

Now, on to the actual docs...

### The Hydrator
This method takes an assoc array of data and hydrates the object's public properties while also converting the data to the proper types (when it can). The property name must match an array key in the incoming array.

Hydration attributes are pre-hooks into the assigning of the properties. They use the incoming value to transform it into something different than assigning it directly. They can also be used as pre-validation. As a bonus, fully chainable.

#### Basic Usage:
```PHP
$SomeStructObj->hydrate($_POST);
```

#### Conversions
When hydrating an object, the data that is passed in is not always the type you need. So I will try and convert it for you behind the scenes. This can be turned off with a special settings attribute.

**Conversion Notes:**
* Bools use PHP's `filter_var` to convert common bool strings. When used with a default value, checkbox values in forms becomes very simple to manage.
* Array conversions are only done on empty values. Everything else will fail. If you want to convert a value to an array, please create a hydration attribute.
* For simplicity, conversions are skipped if the data type of the property is some sort of object. That opens too many cans of worms to deal with. You'll need to make your own custom Hydration attribute if you want to populate object properties.

#### Attributes
TODO

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### The Tailor
This method tailors (aka alters. Ya know, like a tailor does to clothes) the data in an objects public properties using various tailor attributes.

#### Basic Usage:
```PHP
$SomeStructObj->tailor();
```

#### Attributes
TODO

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### The Validator
This helper validates the data in an objects public properties and returns `true` if it is all valid. The validation runs on each parameter that has one or more validation attributes. All failure messages are kept in an array and can be retrieved with the method `getMessages()`.

There is an optional, but recommended, attribute for you to use to customize the validation failure messages for validation attribute. This is explained below in the **Custom Failure Messages** section.

#### Basic Usage:
TODO

#### Attributes
TODO

#### Custom Failure Messages
This is not so much a validation attribute as it is a validation helper attribute. This is so that error messages coming from the validation will be more useful for everyone. Here is an example of how it is used on a property.

```PHP
#[Trim]
#[NotEmpty]
#[ValidatorFailureMessage(NotEmpty::class, 'The email field is required!')]
public string $email;
```

When the validation method is run, and the value in $email is empty, that error will be added to the messages array and the object will ultimately fail the validation check.

Side note: As you can see, I'm not using named properties for this since it is fairly simple. First param is the validation attribute the message is for, the second param is the failure message. The attribute declaration for these when using named params can get lengthy, especially for longer messages, so I omitted them in all my examples and demo. Feel free to use named params though, it won't break anything to use them, except maybe your linter.

## How to run the demo
Make a copy of this project via cli or by downloading. Run `composer install` in the project root, then run the following command (also in the project root) to spin up a dev PHP server for the demo:
```shell
php -S localhost:8000 demo/index.php
```

Then use a web browser on the same computer to visit the following url:\
http://localhost:8000/

## Contributing
This project will always strive to maintain **100% Code Coverage** via **integration tests** and **PHP Stan Level 9!**

I gladly welcome feedback and suggestions via Github Issues. I thrive on constructive feedback.

Bugs of course are submitted via Github Issues as well.

#### Adding New Attributes
When it comes to adding/requesting new attributes into this library, I ask myself the question: `Would this be useful for everyone? Or just myself?`

#### Code Styling Basics
* Curly braces `{ }` start on new lines. It is cleaner to look at.
* Classes are PascalCase.
* Methods are camelCase.
* Variables that hold objects use PascalCase, otherwise they use snake_case.
* Use strict typing as much as possible.
* Run `composer beautify` before staging commits.

#### Testing Requirements
* PHP Stan Level 9.
* All tests should be integration tests. Aka, should run like you are actually using the library.
* 100% Coverage is a hard requirement. Combined with the previous one, we can find unreachable code and remove it.
* Method mocking should be a last resort.
* You need a really good reason to use `@codeCoverageIgnore` or similar flags.
